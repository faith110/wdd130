                <h2>history</h2>
                <p>Whitewater rafting has a rich history that dates back centuries. 
                    Indigenous communities and early explorers used wooden rafts and canoes to navigate rivers for 
                    transportation, trade, and survival. However, rafting as a recreational and extreme sport began to 
                    take shape in the mid-20th century.The modern era of whitewater rafting started in the 1940s and 1950s 
                    when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and adventure enthusiasts began using rubber rafts, 
                    originally developed for military purposes, to navigate wild rivers. The sport gained popularity in the 
                    1970s with the rise of commercial rafting companies, offering guided trips to the public. 
                    As technology advanced, so did the design of rafts, making them more durable, stable, and safe for all skill levels.
                    Today, whitewater rafting is enjoyed worldwide, with famous rafting destinations spanning from the Grand Canyon in the United States 
                    to the Zambezi River in Africa. It has evolved into a thrilling activity that attracts adventurers, 
                    nature lovers, and families looking for an exciting way to experience the great outdoors. 
                    Whether for recreation, competition, or simply the love of adventure, 
                    whitewater rafting continues to grow as one of the most exhilarating water sports on the planet.
