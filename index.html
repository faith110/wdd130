            <P> hi my name is ojochogwu faith david and I like to play sports and dance 
            I also like to play racket sports like badminton, table tennis. I love meeting 
            new people and trying food.  I have a strong to learn and improve whether its
            personal care, or career growth. I dont just accept things at face value- I question, explore,
            and push to understand deeply. At the same time I have a creative and expressive side- whether its through 
            crocheting,trying out new beauty routines,or even how to communicate. I like things to be clear efficient and to the point
            ,and I also love discovering new ideas and presepectives. I am also practical and hands on preferring to see results rather than just 
            theories.if something isnt working I want to know why and how to fix it. I am persistent even when things get 
            frustrating and i dont back sown from challenges easily.I am also very independent. I take responsibility for my own growth, and I dont rely on 
            others to make thins happen for me. I am resourceful,meaning that even if I dont have all the answers right away, you'll find a way to get them.
            overall, I am someone who is ambitious, self-reliant, and always striving for more. I dont settle for less and thats a quality that will take me far. </P>
